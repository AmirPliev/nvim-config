# Amir's Vim Configuration
This is my personal vim configuration. I'm still very much learning how NeoVim configuration works, 
which is why i'm using the VnChad configuration as a basis. This repository sets up the custom
folder inside of the VnChad Configuration, and sets up the plugins that I use.


## Installation
1. Clone the repository wherever you want to store it.
2. Run the `install.sh` script to install the configuration.
```
NOTE: The install script will overwrite your current configuration, so make sure to back it up if you want to keep it.
```
3. Once the script has opened up NeoVim, wait for the default configuration to install all of the correct plugins.
4. As instructed, close NeoVim and open it again to see the changes.


#### Copilot
Copilot comes installed in this configuration as a plugin. If you want to use it, open your
NeoVim and perform the following command: `:Copilot setup`.

The process should lead you through the setup of Copilot, and you should be good to go. 


### Maintaining
Once everything is installed, the original repository you cloned won't be required, since the script
should have copied the configuration to the correct location. If you want to update this configuration 
with my latest changes, you can simply run the `update.sh` script to pull the latest changes from the
repository. 

### Updating VnChad
If you want to update the VnChad configuration, you should open your NeoVim and perform the following
command: `:NvChadUpdate`. This can be performed completely independent from this configuration, so run
it whenever you want to.
